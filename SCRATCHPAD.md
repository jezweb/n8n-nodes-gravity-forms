## Git Commits Plan

2. feat: add form submission operation to entry resource
3. docs: update README with trigger node documentation
4. chore: bump version to 0.4.0

## Notes
- Gravity Forms API returns forms as objects (use Object.values())
- Need to handle both webhook and polling modes
- Submission endpoint processes through full validation
- Keep AI tool compatibility (usableAsTool: true)
